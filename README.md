# IOI.guide

IOI.guide is a series of guides to [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) - a field of mathematics - in a simple, interactive and fun way. Combinatorics, for example, can be used to count premutations of a set. It is the primary subject of the [International Olympiad of Informatics](https://ioinformatics.org/), and a secondary subject in the [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/).

## Development

This web app uses [Bun](https://www.bun.sh) for development. Run `bun install` to install dependencies, `bun dev` to start a dev server with HMR and `bun start` for prod.

### Electron

If you wish to use Electron, first install electron using guides from all over the internet. We may have our own electron build in the future. If we do, we are going to update this guide and include Electron as a dependency.

To get the application as an HTML bundle, use the `bun run build` command.
